# odin-recipes

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website. This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I will demonstrate my skill that I have learned on The Odin Project, such as :
- create a html file and its boilerplate
- build the file with elements and tags
- contain links and images to the file
- make some lists (unordered and ordered)
